#### Original AWS Tests (`tests/aws.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Integration testing with actual AWS services
- **Coverage**: Real AWS IoT Secure Tunneling service calls
- **Test Count**: 1 test
- **Note**: Requires AWS credentials and should be used for manual verification

### 2. Testing Infrastructure

#### Mock Framework
- **Library**: Mockall (v0.13)
- **Usage**: Creating mock AWS clients for isolated testing
- **Benefits**:
  - No dependency on external AWS services during testing
  - Predictable test behavior
  - Fast test execution
  - Complete control over service responses

#### Async Testing
- **Library**: tokio-test (v0.4)
- **Usage**: Testing async operations and performance
- **Benefits**:
  - Proper async operation testing
  - Performance measurement capabilities
  - Async error handling validation

#### Dependency Injection
- **Implementation**: `TunnelClient` trait
- **Benefits**:
  - Enables easy mocking of AWS services
  - Improves testability
  - Supports different implementations (real vs mock)

### 3. Test Configuration

#### Features
- **test-utils**: Enables mock utilities for testing
- **Optional mockall**: Mockall is only included when test-utils feature is enabled

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with mocking enabled
cargo test --features test-utils

# Run specific test categories
cargo test error_tests
cargo test integration_tests
cargo test aws_business_logic_tests
cargo test performance_tests

# Run with verbose output
cargo test --features test-utils --verbose
```

- `create_mock_open_tunnel_output()`: Creates mock AWS response objects
- Helper functions for common test scenarios

#### Test Utilities
- Predefined error instances for testing
- Common assertion patterns
- Performance benchmarking utilities

### 6. Continuous Integration

#### Test Execution
- All tests run automatically on code changes
- Tests must pass before merging
- Performance regression detection

#### Test Requirements
- Minimum 95% test coverage for new code
- All new features must include corresponding tests
- Performance tests must not exceed baseline thresholds

## Benefits of This Testing Strategy
